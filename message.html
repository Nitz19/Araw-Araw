  <h1>My Lovey ðŸ’Œ</h1>

  <p>
I know this is just a small thing, but I wanted to surprise you in a way you didnâ€™t expect. Maybe itâ€™s a video, maybe itâ€™s this message â€” but everything I make for you comes from the heart.

Happy 7th Anniversary, Lovey.

Seven years na tayo lovey seven years of love with you. 
Seven beautiful years of love, growth, memories, and holding each other close through every high and low.
And still, it feels like day oneâ€”like that very first moment we truly met in person.

I remember it so clearly. My heart was racing, my hands were shaking, because for the first time, I saw you not through a screen, not through video calls or chatsâ€”but in real life. You were just there in front of me, and I couldnâ€™t believe how someone as beautiful as you, someone I had been talking to all this time, was now right here. I still remember that moment so vividly, and every time this day comes, I relive that same emotionâ€”my heart still beats faster for you.

Naalala mo paba lovey yung rabbit app or website bayon that one na ginawa kong paraan to have a voice call with you. talagang inis pa tayo sa PLDT non while watching some movies ihh gabi gabi laging movie ihh pero deep inside, all I wanted was to hear your voice gamit yung rabbit app to have a call with you one of my way for you to have us a call diba sobrang worth it from rabbit app to 7 years of love hihi I love youu you always worth for effort Lovey always

malayo na tayo pero still malayo pa lovey pero yung past natin ang tignan natin na dating tamang ipon muna ng pera to have a date or even to buy a food or watch some movies in SM also sobrang hirap tayo lagi nag iintay ng bus sa tapat ng SM na experience pa natin nanakatayo sa bus kasi punuan pero ngayon kaya nanatin yung mga kinakaingitan lang natin dati lovey kaya let's keep chasing our dream laging paangat lang ng paangat di tayo susuko hangat sa magulat nalang tayo na yes we made it.

Since then, and every single day that followed, I have admired you endlessly. You are beautifulâ€”not just in the way you look, but in how you carry yourself, how you think, how you love, how you care for the people around you. You are smart, you are strong, you are kind, and you are joyful even when the world doesnâ€™t always make it easy for you. You shine even on your darkest days. Even when you feel weak or down, I still see the strongest woman I know standing in front of me. Thatâ€™s how I see youâ€”always.

And I want you to know, nothing has changed. If anything, Iâ€™ve just fallen deeper for you with each passing year. I told you before, and Iâ€™ll say it again now and forever: whatever happens, no matter how you change, no matter what you go through, I will always choose you. I love you for everything that you are, even the parts you think are flawsâ€”because to me, theyâ€™re just pieces of the person I love most.

Nobodyâ€™s perfect, and we both know relationships arenâ€™t always easy. But Iâ€™ve made my choice every single day for the last seven years, and itâ€™s always been you. Even if we argue, even when times get hard, my love for you stays the sameâ€”it only grows.

You know how I feel about trust. Cheating is something I will never do, because I know how it can destroy someone. Even if I havenâ€™t experienced it firsthand, I understand the pain it brings. And Iâ€™ve always believed this: cheating is never an accidentâ€”itâ€™s a choice. And the only reason someone cheats is because theyâ€™re no longer content or they stop appreciating what they have. But thatâ€™s not me. Because with you, I am always content. I am always thankful. I am always full. You are more than enough for me, and you always will be.

I know today has been hard for you. Youâ€™ve been feeling down about yourself. But please, take this to heart: you are not weak. You are one of the strongest Woman I know. Youâ€™ve faced so much, and youâ€™re still here, still standing, still fighting. I admire that about you. I see your strength, even when you canâ€™t. I believe in you, even when you doubt yourself. And Iâ€™ll always be here to lift you up when you feel like youâ€™re falling.

You are strong. You are smart. You are worthy. You are loved.

Mahal, I want to end this by telling you something inspired by the song Araw-Araw by Ben&Benâ€”a song thatâ€™s always reminded me of us:

"Araw-araw kitang mahal."
Every single day, I choose you.
Every single day, I fall in love with you all over again.
And even when days are hard or ordinary, I still find something new in you to love.
Just like the song says, "Kung pagbibigyan ang bugso ng damdamin kong minsan ay hindi maintindihan..." I may not always be the best with words, I may not always know the perfect thing to sayâ€”but my love for you is constant, unshaken, and real.

I love you with all my heart, every hour, every moment, araw-araw.

Happy Anniversary ulit Lovey ko I love you so much
